## Internship Report

Bioinformatics is a science field that is similar to but distinct from biological computation, while it is often considered synonymous to computational biology. 
Biological computation uses bioengineering and biology to build biological computers, whereas bioinformatics uses computation to better understand biology. 
Bioinformatics and computational biology involve the analysis of biological data, particularly DNA, RNA, and protein sequences.

Bioinformatics is an integral part of research forming the cornerstone whence sense is made out of scientifically generated data. Understanding why and how data analysis
is done, therefore is an important step in training new Bioinformatics technicians.

Following the MBBU-Internship (2020) at ICIPE, I have been able to;

1. Understand the use of Slack for communications.

2. Understand the basics of use of Git and Github for code documentation, review and collaboration.

3. Understand the basics of Project Organization and Planning.

4. Been introduced to programming (Bash, Python and R) for data analysis. Link for these practices can be found [here](https://github.com/BryanAbuchery?tab=repositories)

5. Understand the need for reproducible bioinformatics.

6. Introduced to Genomics, Biological Databases, Alignment and Phylogenic analyses

7. Completed a 16S rRNA data analysis miniproject through use of different bioinformatics pipelines to create an analysis workflow. Link for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/mbbu/16S-mini-project)

## What next

Use the above gained knowledge and experience to pursue a career in Bioinformatics as being a key component of scientific research.
